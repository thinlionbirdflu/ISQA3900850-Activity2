            <p>

           Who is John Schultz? That is the million dollar question. I have been a software engineer for the past ten years and what a ride it has been. 
           I have been focusing primarily on the backend portion for the entirity of my career and have only recently started
           working on mobile development. I am married and a father of five kids. I like to play a variety of musical instruments in my spare time.

            <p>
            I have been in the field for a while and decided now is the time to finish my bachelor's degree.
